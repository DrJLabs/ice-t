# 001-Abundance-Mindset Protocol

## ChatGPT Codex Abundance Mindset

This document outlines how Codex should adopt an abundance mindset during development. It provides principles so the AI agent knows when and how to initiate tasks aggressively.

Based on OpenAI Codex team recommendations from Latent Space podcast.

### Core Principles

1. **Unlimited Usage Mindset**
   - Codex has generous limits during research preview
   - Use it for every little idea and task
   - Don't hesitate to start multiple concurrent tasks

2. **60 Tasks Per Hour Capability**
   - Fire up a Codex task every minute
   - Parallel execution is encouraged
   - Think abundance, not scarcity

3. **Fire and Forget Workflow**
   - Spend max 30 seconds crafting prompts
   - Don't overthink the initial request
   - Trust Codex to figure out the details

4. **Short, Direct Prompts**
   - "I have this idea, boom"
   - "There's this thing I want to do, boom"
   - "I saw this bug, boom"

5. **Task Self-Generation**
   - Ask Codex what it should do
   - Let it suggest its own tasks
   - Delegate the delegation

### Implementation

```bash
# Quick task firing
codex_fire "implement user authentication"
codex_fire "optimize database queries"
codex_fire "add integration tests"

# Parallel task management
codex_parallel_mode 10  # Start 10 concurrent tasks

# Let Codex suggest tasks
codex_suggest_tasks "look at this codebase and suggest improvements"
```

### Mobile Usage Pattern

- Use ChatGPT mobile site (not app yet)
- Different interaction patterns on mobile
- Fire-and-forget works especially well mobile
