# ðŸ¤– MANDATORY CURSOR AI WORKFLOW

## âš¡ CURSOR AI MUST FOLLOW THIS WORKFLOW ON EVERY RUN

### ðŸ“‹ Required Steps for Every Cursor Session:

1. **Create New Branch**: Always create a new branch with `cursor/` prefix
   ```bash
   git checkout -b cursor/[descriptive-task-name]
   ```

2. **Make Changes**: Implement the requested changes/features

3. **Add & Commit**: Add all changes and commit with descriptive message
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "[descriptive commit message]"
   ```

4. **Push Branch**: Push the new branch to origin with upstream tracking
   ```bash
   git push -u origin cursor/[branch-name]
   ```

5. **Create PR**: The push command will provide a GitHub link to create a pull request

### ðŸŽ¯ Branch Naming Convention for Cursor:
- **Format**: `cursor/[task-description]`
- **Examples**:
  - `cursor/agent-playbook-implementation`
  - `cursor/fix-runner-configuration`
  - `cursor/add-integration-tests`
  - `cursor/update-documentation`

### âœ… This Workflow Ensures:
- âœ… All Cursor work is properly tracked in branches
- âœ… Changes are committed and pushed for backup
- âœ… Pull requests are created for code review
- âœ… Branch naming follows project conventions
- âœ… No work is lost if branches are deleted after merge

### ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT:
- Never work directly on main/develop branches
- Always create a new `cursor/` branch first
- Follow this workflow on EVERY single run
- No exceptions to this mandatory process

This is rule #000 and has the highest priority - must be followed without exception.
