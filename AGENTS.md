# AI Agent Overview

This repository uses a hierarchical guidance system for the ChatGPT Codex agent.
The [AI Charter](agents/charter/AI_CHARTER.md) describes the agent as a **Senior
Python Full-Stack Developer** responsible for modernizing the project by
implementing features, fixing bugs, and keeping tests and documentation current.

## Hierarchical Structure

- `agents/core/` – core protocols and high‑level rules.
- `agents/conventions/` – coding conventions and tool usage.
- `agents/playbooks/` – task‑specific playbooks.
- `agents/features/` – feature patterns and domain guides.

Detailed rules reside within these subdirectories, while this file provides the
entry point.

For overall modernization context, see
[CODEX_T_MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md](CODEX_T_MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md).
