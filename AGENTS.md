# Agents Documentation Index

This repository provides detailed guides for human and AI contributors. Start here to understand the hierarchy and where to find specific rules.

## Hierarchy

- **AI Charter** (`agents/charter/AI_CHARTER.md`) – mission guidelines and CI failure analysis resources.
- **Conventions** (`agents/conventions/`) – coding conventions and tool usage, including how to run `scripts/adaptive_test_runner.py`.
- **Playbooks** (`agents/playbooks/`) – step-by-step instructions for implementing features and other tasks.

Additional information about the CI logging and metrics system lives in `docs/CI_LOGGING_SYSTEM.md` and is referenced from the charter.

Always consult these guides before modifying code or documentation.
