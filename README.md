# ice-t

Autonomous high-performance template for webâ€‘app projects driven by Cursor & Codex.

## Development Setup

1. Create and activate a Python 3.12 virtual environment.
2. Install runtime dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Install development tools:
   ```bash
   pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
   ```
4. Install pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```
   The project expects **pre-commit 3.7.0 or newer**. Verify with `pre-commit --version`.
5. Run tests to verify the environment:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```


## Self-hosted Runners

The CI pipelines rely on a pool of self-hosted runners labeled `ice-t` with additional role labels such as `build`, `test`, and `quality`. Ensure at least one runner for each role is online so workflows can execute.
